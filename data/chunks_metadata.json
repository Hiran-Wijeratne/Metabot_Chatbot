(Minimum power requirement: 1300 w). 4. The Charging Station comes with a 100 cm long power cord. The AC power socket should be within 100 cm of the Charging Station. 5. Avoid direct sunlight and sun exposure in order for META-SCRUB 60 to initialize localization, depart from the Charging Station and return to Charging Station by scanning the QR code. 6. The charging station must be fixed to the wall and positioned on flat ground for optimal results (to get charging plate alignment). Failing to do so might cause hazards during or after cleaning operations, such as automatic-localization loss, fail return to the charging station, and uneven charging cycle of the robot. 100 cm 100 cm 200 cm AC Power Socket Charging Station",
